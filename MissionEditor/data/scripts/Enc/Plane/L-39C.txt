The Aero L-39 Albatros is a high-performance jet trainer aircraft developed in Czechoslovakia by Aero Vodochody. The aircraft was designed during the 1960s as a replacement for the Aero L-29 Delfín as a principal training aircraft. The L-39 Albatros has the distinction of being the first of the second-generation jet trainers to be produced, as well as being the first trainer aircraft to be equipped with a turbofan powerplant. 

The L-39 Albatros was produced from 1971 to 1996. The aircraft was widely exported to a wide range of international operators as a military trainer. To date, more than 2,800 L-39s have served with over 30 air forces around the world.
