A dual-purpose truck with 6x6 wheel arrangement produced at the Ural Automobile Plant in Miass, Russia. The main purpose of the plant is to transport people and cargo, tow various vehicles and trailers on roads of any type and on rough terrain. Thanks to the 6x6 wheel configuration, impressive ground clearance and a powerful unit, the vehicle confidently crosses the wetlands and has a huge off-road potential.

KUNG is the English transcription of the Cyrillic initialism КУНГ for Russian: Кузов Унифицированный Нулевого (Нормального) Габарита (Unified Body of Zero [Standard] Dimension). The KUNG is a Soviet then Russian term for a standardized military vehicle module/trailer system.
