The T-90 is a further evolution of the T-72 MBT, created in 1989 by the UKBTM design bureau as the T-72BU (“object 188”). The tank underwent and successfully completed state trials the same year. The tank was designed in parallel with the more technologically advanced “object 187”, but as a consequence of the worsening economic situation, the relatively simpler T-72BU was selected for production and e-named as the T-90.
Limited serial production was launched in 1992. Initially the tank was equipped with a cast turret similar to the turret of the T-72B, but this was later changed to a welded turret design.
The fire control system of the T-90 was largely borrowed from the T-80U with some modifications. The “Shtora-1” electro-optical IR jamming system is a standard feature of the tank’s defense systems, used to jam incoming SACLOS type laser-guided anti-tank missiles.
The T-90’s level of protection is a significant improvement over its T-72B predecessor. At the time of service entry, it was capable of withstanding nearly every NATO anti-armor round. Today however, this level of protection is no longer current and cannot defend against the latest NATO anti-armor projectiles such as the M-829A2/M829A3.
