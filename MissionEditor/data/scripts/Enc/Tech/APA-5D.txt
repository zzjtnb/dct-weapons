Aerodromic mobile electric unit APA-5D is an autonomous source of electrical energy and is designed for single and group start of aircraft engines, power supply of on-board electrical equipment of aircraft in ground conditions, as well as for towing of aircraft.

APA-5D is designed for:
 -Single or group electric starter start of aircraft engines in the modes "24V Startup", "24/48V Startup" with switching the power source from 24 to 48V both on the electric generating set and on the aircraft;
 -Single electric starter start of aircraft engines in the "70 V startup" mode with a smooth increase in voltage from 0 to 70 V;
 Single and group power supply of onboard electric equipment of aircraft with direct current voltage 28.5 V, alternating single-phase current 120 V with frequency 400 Hz, alternating three-phase current 208 V with deduced power neutral and voltage 37 V without power neutral with frequency 400 Hz.
