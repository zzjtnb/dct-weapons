The designation AGM-65H was assigned to AGM-65B/D missiles upgraded with the new CCD TV seeker. It was originally planned to convert many old AGM-65Bs and -65Ds to AGM-65H standard, but these plans were apparently cancelled in favour of the AGM-65K. Same 125 lbs warhead as in AGM-65A. The CATM-65H is the captive-carry training version of the AGM-65H.
