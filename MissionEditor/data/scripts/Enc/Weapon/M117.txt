The M117 is a free-fall, unguided, general purpose 750-pound bomb. The M117 is employed in several configurations. The basic M117 dates from the Korean War and uses a low-drag tail fin for medium and high-altitude deliveries. The M117 series was used extensively during the Vietnam War, and B-52G aircraft dropped thousands of tons of M117 and M117R bombs during Operation Desert Storm. The B-52s dropped virtually all of the M117 bombs during Desert Storm.
