The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a guidance kit that converts unguided bombs, or "dumb bombs" into all-weather "smart" munitions. JDAM-equipped bombs are guided by an integrated inertial guidance system coupled to a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, giving them a published range of up to 15 nautical miles (28 km). The guidance system was developed by the United States Air Force and United States Navy, hence the "joint" in JDAM. The JDAM was meant to improve upon laser-guided bomb and imaging infrared technology, which can be hindered by bad ground and weather conditions. Laser designators are now being fitted to some JDAMs.

The GBU-31 is a standard Mk-84 general purpose bomb fitted with a JDAM guidance kit. The GBU-31 has the strakes along the sides of the bomb to improve flight characteristics.
