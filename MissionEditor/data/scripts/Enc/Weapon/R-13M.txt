The R-13M was a further improved version of the R-3 series and entered service in 1974. The new missile was roughly equivalent to the improved USN AIM-9G Sidewinder, with a new proximity fuse, more propellant for longer range, better maneuverability, and a more sensitive nitrogen-cooled seeker head.
