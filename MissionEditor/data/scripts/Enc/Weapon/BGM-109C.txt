The BGM-109C TLAM-C (Tomahawk Land-Attack Missile - Conventional) is a conventionally-armed missile for long-range strikes against high-value targets. The missile entered U.S. Navy operational service in 1986. It uses the INS/TERCOM suite for mid-course guidance and the AN/DXQ-1 DSMAC (Digital Scene Matching Area Correlation) system for higher accuracy in the terminal phase of the flight. The AN/DXQ-1 DSMAC's accuracy is about 10 m (30 ft) CEP.
