The Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD) is an expensive tail kit that turns existing unguided cluster munitions dispensers into all-weather precision guided weapons. It corrects for launch transients, ballistic errors, and winds aloft even released from high altitude or weather condition.
The WCMD use inertial guidance only (no GPS).

CBU-105 is the same CBU-97 with inertial guidance kit.
