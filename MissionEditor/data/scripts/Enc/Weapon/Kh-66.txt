The Zvezda Kh-66 is an early Soviet tactical air-to-surface missiles with a range of 10 km. The missile was intended for use against small ground or naval targets. The Kh-66 was effectively a heavy-warhead, beam-riding version of the K-8 (AA-3 'Anab') air-to-air missile entered into service in Vietnam in 1968.

The Kh-66 missile was a temporary solution because of technical issues appeared when developing the Kh-23 missile.
