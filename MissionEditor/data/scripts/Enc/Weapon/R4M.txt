The 55 mm R4M was the first air-to-air rocket that could be effectively used against aerial targets. The R4M warhead equiped with strongly brisant Hexogen explosive charge of 520 g that provided destroying of a heavy Allied bomber with one hit. As a comparison, accordingly to the Luftwaffe statistic it took an average of twenty 20 mm hits to shoot down a typical four-engined Allied bomber.

The R4M could be fired from 1,000 m, just outside the range of the bomber's defensive machine guns. Only a small number of aircraft were fitted with the R4M, mostly Messerschmitt Me 262s and Fw 190s, which mounted them on small wooden racks under the wings.
