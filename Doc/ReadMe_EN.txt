I.SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Minimum system requirements: OS 64-bit Windows 7/8/10; DirectX11; CPU: Core i3; RAM: 8 GB; Free hard disk space: 35 GB; Video: 2 GB RAM card, DirectX11 - compatible; requires internet activation.

Recommended system requirements: OS 64-bit Windows 7/8/10; DirectX11; CPU: Core i5+; RAM: 16GB; Hard disk space: 35 GB; Video: NVIDIA GeForce GTX780 / ATI R9 290 4 GB RAM, DirectX11 or better; Joystick; requires internet activation.


=======================================================

II.INSTALLATION 

After downloading the DCS Web Installer, double click the setup file and then follow the on-screen instructions.

It is recommended to turn off anti-virus and security software, because they can slow the installation process considerably.


=======================================================

III.DOCUMENTATION

Game manuals are supplied in PDF format and can be found in the “Doc” folder of the corresponding Mods directories.
For example, the Su-25T manual is placed into DCS World\Mods\aircraft\Su-25T\Doc folder.


=======================================================
IV.MULTIPLAYER

Although many improvements and optimizations have been made, we still highly recommend 16 player limit when hosting complex missions. Depending on the exact composition of the mission, the bandwidth and number of players that a host may accommodate will vary. As always though, clients must be aware of their ping times (often influenced by connection distance to host) as this can cause warping and other connection issues.

=======================================================

V.MISSION FILES

The mission file extension *.MIZ is a ZIP archive and can be opened with any archive editing software. A MIZ file will always contain at least the mission and options lua files. However, it can also contain additional files depending on the design of the mission, such as briefing images, audio files and avionics system files that can be included as part of the Prepare Mission function.

=======================================================

VI.VIDEO

For video you can download Theora codec here: http://www.xiph.org/dshow/
Also Theora video can be played on the VLC player for example.

OPTIONS – SYSTEM – GRAPHICS:

It is possible to split the game window on two or three displays.
To do so, access your video card configuration options to set a single workspace on monitors. In the game options, select the overall workspace resolution and choose the required MONITORS preset (1 camera, 3 cameras) in the graphics options menu.
The preset configurations can be found in Config\MonitorSetup folder.
